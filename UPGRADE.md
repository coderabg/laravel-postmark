# Upgrade Guide

## From v3.0 to v3.1

If you are manually constructing PostmarkTransport for any reason, the list of dependencies has change and now includes an array for passing in Guzzle options to the Laravel HTTP client.

## From v2.11 to v3.0

With the release of Laravel 9 came an upgrade to Symfony 6, which included adoption of their new `symfony/mailer` component. That meant a complete re-write of this package, which means there are a few things you'll want to check out during the upgrade process.

You may remove the `postmark.php` configuration file that is published by this package. We have adopted Laravel's default configuration for the Postmark configuration within the `services.php` file. If you're still using the `POSTMARK_SECRET` environment variable, be sure to update it to `POSTMARK_TOKEN`.

With the re-write of this package came a change to bring the various classes exposed by this package to follow more of a convention then before. If you are using any of the following classes, you will need to update the usage(s) to match the new class name and namespace.

```php
use Coconuts\Mail\MailMessage; // Before
use CraigPaul\Mail\TemplatedMailMessage; // After
```

```php
use Coconuts\Mail\PostmarkException; // Before
use CraigPaul\Mail\PostmarkTransportException; // After
```

```php
use Coconuts\Mail\PostmarkTemplateMailable; // Before
use CraigPaul\Mail\TemplatedMailable; // After
```

Lastly, be sure to pay special attention to the `symfony/mailer` section of the official [Laravel 9 upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/master/upgrade#symfony-mailer) for any other related changes.

## From v2.10 to v2.11

If you were previously catching either `\GuzzleHttp\Exception\ConnectException` or `GuzzleHttp\Exception\ServerException`, they will now be rethrown as `\Swift_TransportException` with the appropriate message, code and previous exception. This change was made to support Laravel's mail [failover configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/mail#failover-configuration).

## From v2.2 to v2.3

You may remove the `postmark` specific key from the `config/services.php` file as we will get your `POSTMARK_SECRET` directly from your `env` file.

```php
return [

    // You can remove this:    
    'postmark' => [
        'secret' => env('POSTMARK_SECRET'),    
    ],

];
```

You can optionally publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Coconuts\Mail\PostmarkServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## From v2.0 to v2.1

When upgrading from v2.0 to v2.1, you can remove the service provider from the providers array in `config/app.php`. This is possible because laravel-postmark v2.1 takes advantage of [Package Auto Discovery](https://laravel-news.com/package-auto-discovery).

## From v1 to v2.0

When upgrading from v1 to v2.0, you will need to change the old service provider back to the MailServiceProvider that comes with Laravel in `config/app.php`.

``` php
Coconuts\Mail\PostmarkServiceProvider::class,
```

And **replace** it with:

```php
Iluminate\Mail\MailServiceProvider::class,
```

After that, you can add the new service provider to the providers array in `config/app.php`.

```php
Coconuts\Mail\PostmarkServiceProvider::class,
```
